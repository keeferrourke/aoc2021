# Advent of Code 2021 (Golfed Version)

ACHTUNG! THERE MAY BE SPOILERS IN THIS REPOSITORY! 

My solutions to AOC2021, golfed in Kotlin.

Code is released under the ISC license. See LICENSE for details.

## Building

This project uses [Hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit) to manage the build toolchain.

Run `./bin/activate-hermit` to set up the environment and download the dependencies.

There is no main! Run the Kotlin Script files directly with `kotlinc -script src/main/kotlin/Day$X.kts`.

## Testing

This project has tests for each solution in `src/test.sh`
Tests just need bash!


## Par for the course
